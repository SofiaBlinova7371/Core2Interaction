      <p>On the bottom of the postbox there were 12 more postcards.</p>
      <p>
        The last one said they were moving to another, but there was no address
        mentioned.

      I still sometimes remember that there is a person in Netherlands who was
      once a little boy sending postcards to Russia to the address no-one often
      used.
