      <h3>1.</h3>
      <p>
        I took Core1 Interaction during the previous semester. It was my first
        experience coding in HTML, CSS and JS. Most of the things I had to learn
        myself, as it was the first time my professor was teaching and I wanted
        to go a bit beyond the class projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most confusing part was JS as we weren’t actually taught how to use
        it, but told to use chat.gpt to write a code.
      </p>

        I am not really into web design, but I thin it is a useful skill for
        graphic designer. Also, the projects sound quite interesting and
        open-ended in terms of approaching, so I will babe able to create works
        I would use in my portfolio. I think the class would be quite useful and
        interesting.

      <p>
        As I mentioned I am not going to be a Web Designer, but understanding of
        web and basic coding skills would be a plus when working with
        advertising agencies, graphic design projects for web or social media
        and personal projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the semester, I was hoping to take it a bit easier, to recover
        my health and mental state, so I hope I will be able to find a balance
        between complicated projects I am excited and proud of and time for
        myself.

        I’ve used GitHub for Core1 Interaction, but I feel a little lost in its
        functions, so a little tutorial or lecture on that would be helpful.

        Building a website has quite a lot of common with creating a poster. The
        task and info you recieve from the client is your basis - your HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way you display the information around the space of the poster is
        the CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        And JS in this case can be any additional details tthat would increase
        the user interaction with the poster. For example, maybe you would use
        some specific lighting when displaying the poster or you would hang it
        somewhere that would allow the user physically interact with the design.

              I came across this New York Design Agency website this week and I
              just found the aesthetic and concept very professional and
              attractive.
