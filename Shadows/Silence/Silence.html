        A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting,
        <span>the</span> paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is
        thinnest, and the alcove where it is <span>darkest</span>. Whenever I
        see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our
        comprehension of the <span>secret</span> of shadows, our sensitive use
        of shadow and light. For the beauty <span>of</span> the alcove is not
        the work of some clever device.

        An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that
        the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within
        <span>emptiness</span>. There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze
        into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower
        vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere
        shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of
        the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the
        darkness immutable tranquility <span>holds</span> sway.

        The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably refers to the
        uncanny <span>silence of</span> these dark places. As children would
        feel an <span>inexpressible</span> chill as we peered into the depths of
        an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where is the key?
        Ultimately it is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished
        from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere
        <span>void</span>.
