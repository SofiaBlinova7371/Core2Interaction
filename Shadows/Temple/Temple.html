          We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples
          of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's
          treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove.
        </p>
        <p class="color">
          So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly
          discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the
          explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible
          brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must
          be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove
          is one of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing
          us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.

          For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface
          upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely the
          same function as the sand-textured wall. This is why we attach such
          importance to age and patina.
        </p>
        <p class="color">
          A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can
          quite destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the
          greatest care.
