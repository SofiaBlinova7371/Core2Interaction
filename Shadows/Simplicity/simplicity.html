      Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a
      hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers
      serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows.

    <div class="container">
      <div class="scroll">
        <h2 class="item">we value</h2>
        <h2 class="item">the scroll</h2>
        <h2 class="item">above all</h2>

      and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or
      painting. Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if
      it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular
      distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected
      advantage both itself and its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an
      otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? Most often the paper,
      the ink, the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of
      antiquity, and this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance
      with the darkness of the alcove and room.
